Here are some instruction related to my work for Meddiff Technologies

1. Problem 1: Implement a group_by_owners function that:

·         Accepts a dictionary containing the file owner name for each file name.

·         Returns a dictionary containing a list of file names for each owner name, in any order.

For example, for dictionary {'Input.txt': 'Randy', 'Code.py': 'Stan', 'Output.txt': 'Randy'} the group_by_owners function should return {'Randy': ['Input.txt', 'Output.txt'], 'Stan': ['Code.py']}. 

File Name: anandShekharDictionaryofGroups.py

	   I have used random variable for the dictionary.
	   Ownersdictionary as input.

Problem 2: Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.
File Name: anandShekharValidatingPalindrome.py

I have removed random special characters from string
this gives as if string is valid.

Problem 3:Write a function to parse a log file & extract details of Errors & Warnings recorded into a separate file.
File Name: anandShekharParseALogFile.py

I have used my errorLog file written on Labview, from which i have read errors line by line 
and count lines. AFter that, i am creating a new error file, check for it. if it exists,
If exits, then error values will append in the existing file.


Problem 4: Write a function that provides a change directory (cd) function for an abstract file system.
File name: anandShekharDirectoryChangeFunction.py

I have used pop and append function to remove and add strings.

Problem 5: Design & develop a web application to maintain records of students.
File Name: anandShekharStudentDataManagementApplication.py

In this problem, I have not used Django/Flask in python. But i have made Data management application using
tkinter library and i have used stm as database.

I know how to make web-application in Visual Studio in C#, but i think of to make all application in same language so that 
i have used Python language.
